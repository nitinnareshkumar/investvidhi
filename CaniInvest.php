    <td width="550" align="left" valign="top" ><span class="greytxt14grey">Before we discuss about "Can I Invest" , let's take a look to see if we should invest in stocks.<br>
What options do we have for investments? Fixed Deposits , Government Bonds , Corporate Bonds , Stocks , Gold , Real estate.
Before making any decision , we must take inflation in consideration.<br>
In early 2000s , a middle class man could easily purchase a decent house in 10 -15 lakhs.Average family was spending 4000-5000 monthly 
for household expenses.Here we have assumed 4 members in the family.Today , the amount for house would be 30-35 lakhs and for household 
expense it would be 10000-12000.So needs have increased around 2 to 2.5 times in span of around 10 years.<br>
Now below are the returns if we have invested 1 lakh in 2012.<br><br>
<table width="700" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Returns</strong> </td>
    <td><strong>Remarks</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed Deposits</td>
    <td>2.15 lakhs , assuming 8% interest per annum</td>
    <td>We have to give tax on this based on income slab.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Corporate Bonds</td>
    <td>2.8 lakhs , assuming 11% interest per annum</td>
    <td>Tax needs to be paid and there is risk involved in bonds , if company do not perform - we dont get any interest.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td>2002 price 5000 , price in 2012 - 30000 ; Return of 6 times</td>
    <td>Long term tax for holding period of more than 3 years otherwise short term tax</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Land</td>
    <td>mostly in between 3-6 times , it is largely depend on the development of the are</td>
    <td>Less Risk</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Stocks</td>
    <td>Sensex was around 3600 in 2002 , in 2012 it is 18000. Return of 5 times </td>
    <td>no tax for holding period of more than 1 year</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

Above table shows that FDs and bonds have not been able to give good amount of returns if we take inflation into account.In fact , the purchasing 
power of money has reduced in these 10 years if we were mainly invested in FDs, Bonds.
We should still some amount in FDs and Bonds but not rely on them to beat inflation or to create wealth.
So we need to rely on Gold , Land and Stocks to create wealth for us.<br>Gold depends on lot of parameters so it is not easy to predict the returns but it past 10 years it has shown consistent return.<br>Land is a good mode of investment and it is likely to be less risky than other forms of investment.Stocks can give maximum returns if the proper analysis is done and investment process is followed.
In these 10 years , Sun pharma stock price has gone 20 times,Titan - 100 times , ITC - 10 times, Asian Paints - 15 times.
<span class="greentxt14">In long term , returns on investing in great companies have surpassed all forms of investments and it is very likely that trend will continue.</span>
